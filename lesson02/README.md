* PyTorch: tensor, attributes, automatic differentiation
* FashionMNIST dataset
* [Dense](FashionMNIST_Dense.ipynb) NN architecture
* [Convolutional](FashionMNIST_SimpleCNN.ipynb) NN architecture
* Git and GitHub

**Assignment 02** (due to Oct 7, 8:30 AM):

* Create [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Play with FashionMNIST scripts (try to improve accuracy on the test set).
* Create your own image dataset and make it publicly available (2-5 categories, 100-300 images per category, cca 1000 images in total). Split it to train and test partitions (75% : 25%).
* Train a simple CNN on your dataset. It is ok if it is not optimal - we will improve it next week.
* Fill in the links to your GitHub and the dataset into the form (the link is on Slack).
