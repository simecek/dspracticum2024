# Data Science Practicum 2024

Welcome to the Data Science Practicum 2024 at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, during the fall semester of 2024/2025. This course aims to equip you with essential data science skills and introduce you to various machine learning techniques through 12 lectures. Rather than focusing solely on theoretical concepts, our emphasis will be on hands-on coding and practical applications.

## Course Info

While the course is still in development, you can refer to its previous versions from [[2023]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2023), [[2021]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2021) and [[2020]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2020) to get an idea of the content and structure.

In the upcoming sessions, we will cover topics like *Convolutional Neural Networks*, *Transformers*, *Language models* and *Anomaly detection*. For the exercises and homeworks, we will predominantly use Python but it is ok to start with zero knowledge of Python under the condition you can code in other langugage (e.g. R).

The course is currently at the full capacity (actually, we are already over the limit). I am really sorry but the 2024 version of the course is now **closed for new registrations**.
