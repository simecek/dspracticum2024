**Assignment 11** (due to Dec 16):

For the last lecture, bring two  two contrasting examples (one of each):

1. **Positive Example:** Highlighting effective, impactful, or innovative use of AI/ML/data science. 
It could be anything you've done or something in the news, the great research paper, ...

1. **Negative Example:** Illustrating misuse, overselling, or misinterpretation of AI/ML capabilities (marketing AI overselling, people using ChatGPT wrong way...)

We will have the prize for both categories. If you want to use slides, send me them through Slack before the lecture (either PDF or something I can open in Google Slides).
