**Assignment 03** (due to Oct 14, 8:30 AM):

* Fine-tune model to your dataset from HW02, use [HW03_hints_finetuning.ipynb](HW03_hints_finetuning.ipynb). Be sure to run the training on GPU. Export and donwload the model.
* Create a free [HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/). Try to run Gradio app that takes an image as input and outputs the predicted class first locally. Then deploy it into [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). You can use [HW03_hints_gradio.ipynb](HW03_hints_gradio.ipynb) to guide you (CPU runtime is fine, you do not need GPU for this step). The results should be something like [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/simecek/teaching_img_classifier).
* Fill in the links to your GitHub repo and the app into the form (the link is on Slack).
